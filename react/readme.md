```
$ npm init react-app my-app
$ npm install react-router-dom@6

Success! Created may-app at C:\code\javascript\react\may-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd may-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!

#### <React.StrictMode> 의미

 strict 모드 변화
strict 모드는 문법과 런타임 동작을 모두 검사하여, 실수를 에러로 변환하고, 변수 사용을 단순화(Simplifying) 시켜줍니다.
